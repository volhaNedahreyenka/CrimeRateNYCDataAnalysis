Crime Rate in NYC Data Analysis
by Volha Nedahreyenka

Dataset
The name of the dataset is NYPD_Complaint_Data_Current__Year_To_Date_. This dataset includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD). I have gotten the data from data.cityofnewyork.us. The dataset I used was updated last on February 3, 2022. 

Summary of Findings
The highest amount of both victims and suspects by race are blacks and white hispanics.The amount of male suspects are much higher than female suspects. If we compare the statistics by the type of the crimes, the highest number of crimes are misdemeanors, then felonies and violations. If we check the crime statistics by borough we can see that the highest number of crimes happened in Brooklyn and the least in Staten Island. By the type of the location, crimes most often happen in the streets. In the course of the analysis, I have also created couple of interactive maps. One of them is the map of the locations where all the rapes from the dataset happened. The second map has the locations of all the crimes that happened in NYC on Christmas Day in 2021. Third map has the locations of all the crimes that happened in 2019. I also found the number of crimes by police precinct.The last map has the locations of all the cases when criminals resisted arrest by borough. Unfortunately, Git Hub does not allow you to view folium maps as a part of jupyter notebook. For this reason the mentioned above maps are placed in two separate folders:html_maps and png_maps (the first one has all the maps as html files and the second one has all the maps as png files).
